# Rotary Encoder Breakout PCBs  
------------------------------ 

Eagle CAD PCB designs for rotary encoder breakout boards. 
Converts the following rotary encoders to 0.1" breadboard format.  
    + TT Electronics: EN12-VS  
    + Bourns: PEC16-2xxxF-Sxxxx  

See one of the following links for drivers that interpret the gray-code on an Arduino.

The PCBs come in different layouts.  The "edge" layout brings all connections to a single row of 0.1" spaced pins.  The "straddle" layout brings signals to two rows of 0.1" spaced pins.  The rows are 0.4" apart such that they will straddle the center channel of common solderless breadboards.

## Component Description  

The encoders listed are "gray-code" encoders.  They also have a push-button switch (normally open).
